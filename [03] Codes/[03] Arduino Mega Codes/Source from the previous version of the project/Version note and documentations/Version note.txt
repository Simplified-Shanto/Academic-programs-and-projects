Functions of different microcontrollers used: 
1. MC0_Arduino Uno 
	works as the main microcontroller of the project. Major tasks 
	includes driving robotic arm, four wheels, obstacle avoidance system, 
	communicating with the mobile app via BT module attached to it, 	communicating with the other microcontroller, handling the shift 	register which handles some part of the robotic arm. 
2. MC1_Arduino Nano
	a. All the sensors are connected to it via it's analog input pins. 
	   Reads these sensor values and sends to MC0_Arduino Uno when 		   when receives respective commands. 
3. MC2_ESP8266
	a. Handles the OLED display which is attached for printing debug 	info and important messages like the IP address of the camera etc. 

4. MC3_ESP32CAM 
	a. Handles camera functionality
	b. Handles timelapsing. 
	c. Sends the IP address connected to MC2_ESP8266
