    <h1>Here we start learning some advanced topic on HTML</h1> 

    <h3 id = "Reminder">Do you remember our original goal? </h3>

    <h3> It's to learn how to make web pages interacative? Simply talking 
        we wanted to apply our javascript knowledge as a webform. </h3> 


     <p id = "linkToWeb"> 
        At this point Pamela Fox is teaching us how to use 
        links in webpages and a bit of history of HTML.
        The punchline of the history is that Tim Berners 
        Lee invented HTML. 
    </p> 
            
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"> Let's read more about Tim Berners Lee

     <p> Here's the original link they showed:

       <p> 
        Here we see a nice picture of Sir Tim Berners Lee. 
      </p> 

        <p id="internalLinks"> Since our page is going to be way long
            it's high time we added an index list. 
            So let's do that. This can be implemented 
            using the technique of internal links. 
            So let's do that. 

            Before we jump right into the action. Let's 
            get clear about internal links. Internal links 
            are links that point to another part of the same 
            website. 
        </p>
           
        <h1 id = "htmlTables">HTML tables</h1> 

        <p> 
            The necessity of table is huge in day to 
            day life. So the case is same for html. In this
            talkthrough we'll mainly learn how to make tables 
            in our page. 
            <br> <br> 
            The tag they are using here is: 
            <br> 
           Oh,  I can't just write this thing. 
           The IDE is considering it as a part of the 
           syntax. So here rises a question: 
           <br> 
           <ul>
                <li> How to add comments in HTML? </li>
                <!--
                    It's a Comment. 
                
                -->
           </ul> 
        </p>

        <p> 
            Ok, that's a bit different in html than C++. 
            All you need to do is to type < !-- Comment->>
            with no space between < and !
        </p>

        <p> 
            Now let's come back to the point, that is adding 
            a table. The process of making a table in html 
            seems to be way tedious. But we have got to learn 
            the stuff. So let's do it. 
        </p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr> 
                    <th> Favourite sites   </th>
                    <th> Cost</th>
                    <th> Using for(in months)</th> 
                </tr>
            </thead> 
            <tbody> 
                <!--Filling in the first column-->
                <tr> 
                    <td> Khan Academy</td>
                    <td>Free</td>
                    <td> 32</td>
                </tr> 
                <!--Filling in the second column-->
                <tr> 
                    <td> Brilliant</td>
                    <td>Upgradable</td>
                    <td> 3</td>
                <!--Filling in the third column-->
                <tr> 
                    <td> Notion</td>
                    <td>Upgradable</td>
                    <td> 3</td>
                </tr> 
                </tr> 
            </tbody>
        </table> 

        <p> 
            The way I thought it to work is not correct. 
            Using the td tags, we are supposed to fill
            in a row first. 
            Then we'll move to next row. So let's startover
            entering data. 
        </p>
        
        <h1 id = comments> Comments in HTML </h1>
        
        <p> Now Pamella is teaching about commenting in HTML. 
            Which we have already learnt. So entrying it just to 
            creating  a pathway we followed. 
        </p>

        <h1 id = "cssIntro">Intro to CSS</h1> 

        <p> It's the time when we start learning CSS. 
            So I think It'll be better to know how to work
            with those 3 types of files separately.
